So I had been tasked with creating a reel for a tech society that I am a part of. I can do video editing in DaVinci Resolve 20. My senior had given me a drive link of all the media.
What I learnt:-
1. Ideation of a reel trying to promote a hackathon
2. How to make the reel engaging - the first 5 sec or the hook
3. How to select and sort the media according to the sequence of the reel
